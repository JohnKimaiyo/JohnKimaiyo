        <p>  SQL Data Analysis Project Idea: You can use the dataset to create an online retail application database in SQL for this SQL project for data analysis. After that, use SQL commands like order by, group by, etc. to answer the following sample questions:</p> 

<li>Which year had the highest sales? </li>

How was the weather during the year of highest sales?

Conclude whether the weather has an essential impact on sales.

Do the sales always rise near the holiday season for all the years?

Analyze the relationship between sales and the different macroeconomic variables in the dataset.
